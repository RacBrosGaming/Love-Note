`Love Note` was created for the [2024 GitHub Game-Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024)

**GitHub Game-Off Theme: SECRETS**

## Backstory

You are attending Ms. Bopple's class and need to find out if your crush, Poppy, is in love with you! So you devise a plan to pass along a note with the help of your fellow students containing a question only she can answer.

## Object of the Game

- Without getting caught, pass the note to your crush and then pass the response back!
- Watch out for the teacher and teacher's assistant, you don't want your note to get confiscated.
- The bully in the class will try to call over the teacher's assistant so be careful.

## How to Play

- Click/Tap the student next to you to pass the note on.
- If playing with a keyboard chose a direction with the arrow keys, then push space bar/enter to send the note that way.
- If the bully (student with the skull and crossbones) gets the note, he will wave it in the air to get the teacher's assistant's attention. He will only wave it for a few seconds so make sure the teacher's assistant is far enough away if you have to go through him.
